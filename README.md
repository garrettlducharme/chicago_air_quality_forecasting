# chicago_air_quality_forecasting

### Problem Motivation

The southeast side of Chicago has been burdened with [poor air quality](https://www.epa.gov/il/environmental-issues-southeast-chicago) for a number of years. After numerous complaints from the residents, the EPA investigated this area in 2013 and found that many manufacturing and handling companies were not in compliance with the clean air act. In 2017, the company S.H. Bell, a monitoring station has been installed so that air quality can be monitored. The goal of this project will be to use past meteorological and particulate matter (PM) data from this station in order to forecast future PM levels in this area of Chicago.
